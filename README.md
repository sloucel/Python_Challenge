I cleared the inital code that I erroneously put in the Readme.md

I spent 9 hours on Saturday going through previous class activities to understand the Python code and its functions. 
I spent over 10 hours on Sunday and Monday putting together the assignment using a combination of class activiies, Xpert Learning Assistant, and ChatGPT to construct and debug the code.  I also seeked clarification on exporting the csv file in office hours. 

# For the PyBank Assignment
    The main.py file is in the Resources folder
        ignore the main_old.py file because I improperly performed uploaded it to git hub and needed to load a new main.py file. 
    The financial_analysis.csv is in the Analysis folder
# For the PyPoll Assignment
    The main.py file is in the Resources folder
    The election_results.csv is in the Analysis folder
